# Want to learn more about Machine Learning beyond the model architectures? Then this book is for you!

Companies are spending billions on machine learning projects, but it’s money wasted if the models can’t be deployed effectively. In this book, Hannes Hapke and Catherine Nelson walk you through the steps of automating a machine learning pipeline using the TensorFlow ecosystem. You’ll learn the techniques and tools that will cut deployment time from days to minutes, so that you can focus on developing new models rather than maintaining legacy systems.
